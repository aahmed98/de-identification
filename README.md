De-identification of Electronic Health Records

This repository contains the code accompanying my AMIA submission: _Benchmarking Modern Named Entity Recognition Techniques for Free-text Health Record Deidentification_

Please refer to either ```testing.ipynb``` or ```ccv_test.py``` for a walkthrough of how to run the code. Note that raw data must be in the i2b2 format. Ensure that ```isLoading``` is set to ```False``` the first time i2b2 data is processed.
