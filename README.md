De-identification of Electronic Health Records

This repository contains the code accompanying my AMIA submission: _Benchmarking Modern Named Entity Recognition Techniques for Free-text Health Record Deidentification_

Please refer to either ```testing.ipynb``` or ```cv_test.py``` for instructions on how to run the code. Note that raw data must take the i2b2 format.
